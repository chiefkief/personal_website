                    Bigfoot prints were first reported by california loggers in 1958. since then bigfoot has spent his time traveling and making appearences all over the country.

                    This page is a more in depth look at HTML and CSS, and should help to make some of the simpler concepts more concrete. This is supposed to be a precursor to PHP and mySQL, since I have a class on server side web dev coming up, but im guessing i'll learn the php in class, so want to know the html, css, and I think javascript before the class starts(in about a month).

            This website will soon hopefully include connection to a mySQL or SQLite database. This will help learn a little bit about <em>database management</em>, which I am going to need for schooling. Classes start on August 26th, and looking at my old classes, there is <strong>a lot</strong> that needs to be touched up on. HTML, CSS and Python should be okay, but I honestly can't remember any of the other classes. hopefully we are starting with new languages so everybody is starting from the same place. Either way, from today there is a full month until classes start, that leaves 4 weeks to brush up on what I need to.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            prior knowledge from school, but honestly not much is remembered. since school, have spent a little time with python, and a bit with lua, thanks to config files. In order to be confident going to school, I would like to brush up on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">HTML & Css</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/">SQLite</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/yz26f8y64n7k07">C#</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/">Java</a>. one website said you should probably know c or c# fundamentals before starting java, so look at c#. That being said though, the C# class was third semester, and the course description says we go in depth into .net, so you will need to come back to c# after you have a firm understanding of the basics of these languages.
