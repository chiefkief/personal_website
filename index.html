        <h2>TODO: add images and links(temporary link to readme)</h2>   <h2><em>maybe some sneaky stuff, gotta keep it entertaining</em></h2>
        <p>
            maybe a sneaky <a href=https://github.com/chiefkief/personal_website rel="noopener">link</a> or <a href=README.md><strong>two(this one is actually readme though).</strong></a>

            honestly, i feel like the learn enough to be dangerous book series is a little bit of a joke. chapter one was just him <em>shilling</em> his other books so you can understand whats going on. and now chapter 2 is <strong>all about the company!</strong> lets just make a website about a donut shop.

        <h3>actually some links I guess</h3>
        <p>
            links are very useful for moving to websites or files(shown above) and can save alot of time if you go to a specific <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatulence target="_blank">website </a>alot
        </p> 
        <h3>A little bit about myself</h3>
        <p>
           I did IT-mobile dev. at CVTC around <em>8 years</em> ago. spent a year in college where I studied for a semester and got laid the other. made a little money though, college is pretty much paid off so its back to school!<br>
