## a second attempt at first github repo
--------------------------------------

7/18
okay, so git is up and running, able to push with no problems, now its actually time to build the website.

Night 1, built foundation for website, added images and links and created image hyperlink to github with logo.

start chapter 3 next(learnenoughhtml&css...)

7/19
spent a little over an hour on book before work, made a page for tags learned. Can now make index look much nicer/actually have a purpose. could make online resume or home page for browser(search bar from search engine, news, used links/server links)

7/21
very slow night at work, was able to add navigation links to top of all pages on mobile, need to style and still make lists in book report, but I wanted the navigation so I can look at my pages easier.

7/22
finished part one of learn enough html and css to be dangerous. Part two starts on a new webpage, might do some more work on this one for personal use, but might end up just continuing the book and starting fresh.
