                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad">The Iliad</a> is an <strong>extremely </strong>old book. it takes place during the trojan war and focuses mainly on Achilles, King Agamemnon, and Ulyses(Odyseus) on the Achean(spartan) side and King Parim, his son hector and one other guy who I forgot on the trojans. that doesn't stop the author from mentioning many more people on both sides than he has to, you even get to learn some of the <em>horses names.</em> 
                That being said, it is a beautifully written story and there is a reason it is still talked about today. It is a very gory story about revenge, love, and gods that kinda just like changing their minds. if you are okay with reading old english(some translations can make it a little easier to read, but some try to stay as close to origional as possible.) the Iliad is definetly worth a read.

                <p>
                
                    ... Diomed looked sternly at him and answered, 'Think not, Dolon, for all the good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an open enemy, but <span>if I kill you and make an end of you, you will give no more trouble.'</span>
                    
                </p>
            </blockquote>

                now just for some context, they find Dolon on the battlefield, where he will obviously die. Dolon begs for his life, diomed tells him not to worry but asks why diomed is so close to the achaean camp. Dolon gives up some really good information and <strong><em>BEGS</em></strong> to be ransomed. Diomed just chops his head off with a sword instead though.
